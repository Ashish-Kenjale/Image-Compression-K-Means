# Image-Compression-K-Means

In this project, I have applied the k-means clustering unsupervised learning algorithm using scikit-learn and Python to build an image compression application with interactive controls.

Steps involved:
* Pre-processing high-resolution image data for k-means clustering
* Conducting basic exploratory data analysis (EDA) 
* Data visualization


Utilized time-efficient implementation of the k-means algorithm, Mini-Batch K-Means, to compress images
and leveraged the Jupyter widgets library to build interactive GUI components to select images from a drop-down list and pick values of k using a slider.
